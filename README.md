# convert-line-ending

Convert encoding to UTF8 with BOM after saving for specified file extensions.
For example, we can commonly store .c;.cpp;.h;.cs;.cshtml;.js;.java using UTF8 with BOM.
And we should not save .bat in UTF8 with BOM encoding.

Based on TextTools on https://github.com/avplayer/convert-line-ending.
Thanks it's author.
